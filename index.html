        <h1>Who is this Crazy Lady and Why is She Here? </h1>
        <p>Nycole was born under a full moon on a cold winter day. Since then, she has been on a mission to become a Jill-
        of-All Tades and gain enough knowledge for world domination. </p>
        <p>She is highly creative and can not help thinking outside the box. This often confuses the locals and scares small
        children. </p>
        <p>By default, she is not the sharpest knife in the box, and therefore, has 1,000,000,000,000.5 questions. </p>

    <div class="center">
        <p>Nycole is a person to be feared.</p>
        <p>Nycole is fiercely loyal and is not above throwing hands when push comes to shove.</p>
        <p>Nycole has been known to knock down small children and the elderly if they dare look at
        her in any sort of way.</p>
        <p>She does not seek forgiveness. </p>
